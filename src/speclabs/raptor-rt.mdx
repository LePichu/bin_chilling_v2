## What is RaptorRT?
RaptorRT is a collaborative effort that sprung a while back into life at ReMod Software as a plan to create the next major Server-sided JavaScript runtime which would truly emphasize the focus on UX/DX, Web Standards Compliance, and how we think about JavaScript performance and concurrency as a whole. It will use the Mozilla's SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine as opposed to Google's V8 or Apple's JavaScriptCore for more customizability and other reasons.

## Why?
To understand, "why?", we need to go back in time, a long while ago. It all started with Node.js, then Deno, and then Bun.

## Prior Art and Why not \<X> Runtime?
Meow.

## Goals, Non-Goals, Explicit Anti-Goals
We have a set of goals we want to fulfill at all costs, somethings that are nice but not needed, and some very explicit things to NOT do.

What we are 100% going for:
- Web Standards Compliance, Top to Bottom, unless Tiny Tweaks can better adjust said API to fit in a server context
- BEAM-like Concurrency, Web Workers implemented as Green Threads
- Adapt existing Web APIs for handling File System and similar alongside the Permissions Model of the Browser for the server, strengthening Web Compatibility
- Adapt `manifest.json` to fit a server context, whilst reviving the `service_worker` field and a new `import_map` field
- Every JS loaded into the runtime has a location representation URL over a protocol like `file://` or `https://`
- Support Meta-programming any JS Subset/Flavors or entirely different languages via Service Workers
- One Configuration File to rule them all, whilst having a set of sane/opinionated defaults for tooling
- Follow Deno's original goal of all tools in one binary, including `ast`, `lint`, `init` (with options) subcommands, custom sub-commands in the core CLI, a proper `bundle` in one way or another, etc.

What we would find nice to have but not necessary:
- Adapt Web APIs like WebRTC, WebTransport, WebGPU, etc. that might not have a traditional/mainstream use
- Future JS Syntax/Features behind Experimental Toggles
- Future JS APIs like ES Compartments, Shadow Realms, and more behind Experimental Toggles
- Server-Sided DOM or CSSOM built-in, there are considerations to be made here

What we are absolutely against:
- Any form of Node/Deno or alternative runtime shim/compatibility as a first party
- Ignoring Community Feedback / Not having Community Transparency
- Faking Benchmarks or any form of False Advertising
## Future of Raptor Tools
Meow?

## Project "Dart" (Edge Platform)
Meow!
