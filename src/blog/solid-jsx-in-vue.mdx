So I will keep it quite shrimple, relatively speaking, so many of you degenerates might know Vue, the popular SFC framework of all things, does have JSX/TSX support with it's own transforms, as for the normal people I don't expect you to know that. But a couple of nights ago, I remembered something, unless you're completely living under a rock you will know about how Vue is getting a "vapor-mode", where it will end up similar to how Solid.js, another popular JSX framework us sane people use, with fine-grained reactivity and other cool stuff. But you know what else I remembered? Vue has JSX and that made me wonder, what would happen to JSX when Vue goes Vapor? The answer, may shock you (not really), I ended up pinging Evan You, aka the creator of Vue in Vue Discord, it's quite shrimple actually, I will let this screenshot speak for itself.
