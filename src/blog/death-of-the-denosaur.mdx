# Death of the Dinosaur

_This post is more of a rant and a tiny announcement. As Deno continues to downgrade itself, I and others no longer have the energy to deal with its bullshit._

I am officially leaving development with Deno as of Deno 1.31. Deno Developers do not want to stick to their own goals. At this point, Deno is just a worse Node.js and hell, Node.js is doing a better job than Deno at being Deno recently. I mean to point at recent additions like:

- URL Imports
- Loaders
- Permissions Model

The above and lots of other things are on their way to Node.js. At ReMod Software, we are halting any work on Deno-related projects until Deno Developers can get their shit together. Popular projects like DWM-GUI and Deno-TUI also have expressed that they are shelving while Deno continues to evolve back into the mess it tried to restore. Deno is becoming a marketing gimmick instead of a good tool. Please remember that 1.31's "marketing" feature, a.k.a `package.json` support, had received a lot of community backlash, hence why it did not ship in 1.30, yet it did now in 1.31.
