Eyo toddlers, today we will be looking at how the **FUCK** you can quickscope some *nae-nae California Green Juice Drinking Ninnie Cry-babies* playing this mid-ass game, with the most the most slow, like slower than your *autistic little brother* slow, but **hard-hitting** sniper, the ***fucking HDR*** from *MIDern Doorfare 2019 It's Doorbin' Time* by *Infinity Tard* ported to *Copium of Duty Mobile* by *TiMi Studios*, more like Timmy Studios. Massive shoutout to my homie [@draw.uy (Tito)](https://draw.uy) from Solid.js Discord for giving me this garbage post idea.

# Loose Ends
So you might be thinking, *"Pichu, what fucking cringe build did you cook up this time, you stupid fuck?"*, and you know what? You are right, I burned the fucking kitchen again by turning the HDR into a quickscopable pile of shit, here's the fucking goofy aah build:

![HDR Build](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/921446533549916253/1176942349297922108/IMG_3955.png?ex=6570b3fa&is=655e3efa&hm=7a643fd7293c5b407a82e8b4cab741ec3df00b223809f430888d7c3a384af2a6)

Before you crackers start calling me retarded, I fucking know, the stats *look ass* but trust this shit is more fire than whatever you ghosted pale as shit looking fuckers can come up with, now **shut the fuck up**, *cope and seethe*, and use this fucking build or *jump off a cliff again* trying to quickscope with your bitch ass shitty Locus build. This shit is comically satisfying, *more so than your mother*. Ok so, what about the secondary? *Shrimply* use anything, fuck it, use a melee, guns are overrated melee is more useful than the shitty secondaries, very effective on everything. You know what? Fuck you, here's a pistol anyways for your mid-ass:

![L-CAR more like W-CAT](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/921446533549916253/1176965263430783028/IMG_3956.png?ex=6570c951&is=655e5451&hm=dc39b11403ebc5aac9265fe252334eade8c14d8ce1093862a4deefa5fc294722)

You done? Now go quickscope yourself some bitches, actually, your broke ass is probably still not ready, time to learn about perks and streaks I guess. Also if you're wondering why is every gun shown purple; Ask yourself *why is your mother gay* first, then you'll get the answer.

So, *"what the fuck should I run?"*, is probably what you're wondering, shrimply put:

- **Red Perk:**
	- Fast Recover (If you wanna take it slow like a pussy)
	- Agile (If you're delusional and like rushing)
- **Green Perk:**
	- Vulture (If you can't hit for shit)
	- Amped (If you're delusional AND a speedy fuck)
- **Blue Perk:**
	- Hardline (If you want to be a fucking bald eagle)
	- High Alert (If you're blind as shit and can't see beyond 5 feet)

Ok what but the streaks? Fuck 'em, just use one of these:
- UAV + Shock RC + Hunter Killer Done
- UAV + Counter UAV + Advanced UAV

A tiny ass collection of some of my clips with the HDR, because you fuckers can't hit for shit and probably think this thing is ass like your father who went get milk after seeing your shit.

# Conclusion
If you somehow performed ass, that's on your half-disabled ass, maybe go back to using your shitty Locus, here is a somewhat competent quickscoping build for you:
