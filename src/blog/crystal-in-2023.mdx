# Crystal in 2023

Crystal is one of the newest yet unpopular languages of the past decade. This year and moving forward, we will see a lot of massive advances to the language, ranging from new platforms to better tooling. Without further ado, here are a few picks why Crystal, going in 2023, will be a more viable option for people. But first, what is Crystal?

## What is Crystal?

Crystal is a statically compiled language with a very similar syntax to Ruby, but with the speed of C as implied by the official website. It leverages LLVM and a simple GC under the hood to achieve this. We can think of it as a dialect of Ruby running on bare metal, parallel to Elixir, which, to an extent, is a dialect running on the BEAM VM Ecosystem.

## Windows Support

Moving forward into this year, we will see better Windows support implied at the "Ask me Anything" event last year. Meaning a user need not be a macOS or Linux user to reap Crystal's benefits but fill the niche of "Ruby but Fast" for Windows APIs too. Recently, the author of Athena Framework, coincidentally also one of the authors of the Crystal Book, blacksmoke16, has expressed concern for slow progress on the Windows Port. As an advocate of Windows Support, we could see the porting take a faster turn this year with HertzDevil working on Crystal full-time.
