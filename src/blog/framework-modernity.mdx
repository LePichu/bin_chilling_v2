A few days ago on Twitter, I expressed some beliefs over Modern day Web Development, specifically avout how we are going backwards instead of forward, how I came to despise the Deno ecosystem more than Node.js somehow, but later the same day, I remembered something, Android ecosystem is fucking 100  worse for absolutely *no fucking reason* besides Google having a kink for blueballing their own app developers!
