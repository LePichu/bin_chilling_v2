*sips violence Milk*, Hello, it's been a while, well I'll try to keep it short and simple, and before we begin, Happy New Year to anywho, yes I know I'm a month late but moving on, my laptop broke down 4 days ago after the HDD started to fail, can't get it fixed at the moment but I felt it to be necessary to update everyone on the stuff which I was cooking, what was being baked in the oven for a while, here's a *very-very* rough list of what I was burning the kitchen for:

- **\[CODM]** This Sniper Rifle is from the Hood: A Short Review on the LW3-Tundra, or the AWP and how meta busting it is at the moment
- **\[CODM]** This Close Quarters Killer is Underrated: Recounts my experience using the Striker-45, aka the UMP-45 and why people are sleeping on it
- **\[Web Dev]** Printing my School Finals project as a Book with HTML: This went into detail on how my insanity and my nature to overcomplicate and over-engineer finally delivered with cursed `@page`d media warcrimes 
- **\[Language Dev]** Cooking your own Programming Language: A Tiny series where I teach about how you can make your own garbage programming language and sell it as the next best thing... *I AM LOOKING AT YOU, **V-LANG!***
- **\[Website]** A Rework of this Website is planned, the home page will be completed and a lot of things like blog, portfolio, and navigation completely refurbished.

![Yep, it's F#cked.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/736493162117464084/1201286677574975488/Snapchat-1259953329.jpg?ex=65c94466&is=65b6cf66&hm=7a86704a07fb21154835c5e0e631a1605d5ed5853c1affcfc553c4f942ebe7e3&)

Besides that's, my business cards came printed albeit a bit fucked because uhh, well long story short; Vistaprint decided to edit the cards design without asking me and they were just like "hey bruh, we edited this because **\[reason]**", and the email went into my spam inbox so I never knew until they came in mail finally, fortunately they refunded the money entirely and let me keep the cards so that ended well.

Had a fucking mental breakdown too so that's something, that's kinda normal for me tho and I ended up going back to vibing to ULTRAKILL soundtrack for some reason so that's, fun. Also had to come to terms with loving someone, so that's also something. There's, so-so much more I wanna talk about but cannot, I also miss home, so fucking much, cherised and dear memories haunt me from time to time. Sometimes, feels like I am barely holding onto life, but it goes on.

There's a lot more announcements related to ReMod Software too, we are setting up shop properly finally at the moment and we expect to be open by March or April, hit us up if you want a Website, Web App, or an App in general made, we'll quote you a price and time span and deliver on our promise, you can hit me up in DMs on Discord at the moment if you like too: **(LePichu#7464)**.
Work on Projects has been well, steady to say the least, we had to axe **RaptorRT** and it's JavaScript Ecosystem to focus on making Zircon, and that too has shifted in goals, we aren't targetting JavaScript anymore, we are targetting BEAM for now and later native for performance improvements. There's also a funny story, my laptop died when I was working with Astro, was trying speedrun a placeholder for ReMod website the night before my English ASL, had to speedrun that shit at 2AM on my phone, fun time.

Well that's all that's been happening really, besides my usual breakdowns and mental deteriorations, I ended up getting addicted to Joji's music and crying myself out because of the loneliness, also hit Legendary in CODM in both MP and BR as usual, my finals are coming up and school is coming to an end, can't fucking wait to finally be free and head back home, I've been stuck in Indian Ohio (i.e. Bihar for a year and half now for my final 2 years) and dear fucking god this shit is a hellscape, fucking Neo Nazis and othe Entitled Children at school make it copium to deal with but fortunately I have TWO (2) friends I can count on. Might get into content creation some way, hopefully by getting a Cat Model to VTube with like how [Futives](https://YouTube.com/Futives) the COD Player has, but also to try take my heads off of things, life has been a fuckup for a good while now and I do wish it ends sometimes but I keep pushing out of spite, I am built like a hater and you know what? That's fine. But anyways, that's it for me, for now at least, see y'all around later next month hopefully.


**PS:** Wrote this at 4AM or almost 4AM my time, any typos or related do let me know so I could fix them, or if you have questions do reach out.
