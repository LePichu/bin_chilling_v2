# A Journey into using Gleam for Mobile Development
<PD thumbnail="/assets/posts/gleam_mobile_thumbnail.png" read_time="5-8 Minutes" publish="04/02/2023" written_by={["LePichu"]} />

*A Note to the Readers: This is a very unfinished post, and lacks polish, it will be edited in a few days again and polished out.* 

A few days ago, I stumbled upon the **Gleam** Programming Language. It is a compiled language with support for **BEAM** and **JS Runtimes or VMs**, so that's stuff like *Erlang, Elixir, Deno, Node, QuickJS* and so forth. I thought, "oh hey, this looks a lot like a scriptable version of **Rust**, and I should try making something with it". So here we are; this is my tiny journey into making an Android App using **Gleam**, with a framework which would lay the possible foundation of using Gleam for developing mobile apps in future.

# What is Gleam?

According to the **Gleam** Website: *"**Gleam** is a friendly language for building **type-safe** systems that scale!"* Built with ðŸ’œ and âœ¨. As I said earlier, it compiles to either **BEAM Bytecode** or **Vanilla JavaScript**. It even has experimental support for **TypeScript Definition** File generation.

**Gleam** can also directly interop with either system, meaning you can call **BEAM Functions** or **JS Functions** using the `external` keyword. This opened the gate to mobile development with Gleam. I work on [RaptorFX](https://raptorfx.deno.dev/), which means I have experience working with System WebView APIs. Coincidentally I have a lot of experience working with **Android's WebView** (and by extension, also had to work with Android APIs) API as it is the one I have used for the most prolonged time.

But why did I decide to use **Gleam**? I personally find its future very promising to me, and I like taking gambles. As with [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), I am willing to take another gamble. Even though **Gleam** is not even *v1.0* yet, It moves quite fast in the positive direction. The sheer amount of things it already has done is enough for me to put my stakes into it. Life is all about taking risks, and this is one I am willing to take. It is us, the programming community to ensure our beloved languages and ecosystems move ahead, I will simply play my part in that.

# Lighting the Furnace Up
To get started, I booted up my IDE, **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate**. The next step was to make an Android Project using the Project Creation Wizard. I dubbed the project *"Starlight"*, symbolizing it as a bright light for the future of **Gleam** and how fast it develops itself.

After 10 minutes of waiting, **Gradle** refreshed dependencies and other things and could start writing some code. But first, I decided to debloat the entire project and removed the start Activity. Fragments, Layouts, and alike.

First, I added a WebView and the necessary boilerplate to load the WebView.


```xml
<WebView
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:id="@+id/starlight_demo"      
/>
```

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        WebView wv = findViewById(R.id.starlight_demo);

        wv.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
        wv.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient());
        wv.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/index.html");
    }
}
```

So let's quickly go over what's happening in these snippets. The top XML part is the layout of the App, well, it is wrapped by a `ConstraintLayout`. Moving on, `MainActivity` is our entrypoint of our actual App. I started out by extending `Activity`, then fetching our WebView and loading the `index.html` files under our `assets` folder.

You might be confused how the project structure at this point looks, so here is how:

```yaml
starlight:
    - app:
        - /src/main/:
            - java:
                - /dev/remod/starlight_demo/:
                    - MainActivity.java
            - assets:
                - index.html
            - res:
                - <layouts/drawables/etc>
    - lib
    - gradle
    - <gradle-files>
```

Now that we have the basic setup out of the way, it was time to start binding calls to Android Runtime to our WebView.

```java
public class StarlightCore {
    @JavascriptInterface
    public static String getPhoneModel() {
        return Build.MANUFACTURER + " " + Build.MODEL;
    }
}
```

Even though a basic function, this could help us test if the WebView Bridge works properly or not. Next, we back in the `MainActivity` we will bind this bridge via: 

```java
wv.addJavaScriptInterface(new StarlightCore(), "Starlight")
```

Now, we can finally start writing glue-code in JavaScript and then move onto writing our Gleam code.

```javascript
// <starlight_shims.js>, mapped as `@remod/starlight`
function getModel() {
    return Starlight.getPhoneModel()
}

function drawToDOM(text) {
    document.body.innerHTML += `
        <h1>${text}</h1>
    `
}
```

```rust
pub external fn get_phone_model() -> String =
    "@remod/starlight" "getPhoneModel"
pub external fn draw_to_dom(text: String) = 
    "@remod/starlight" "drawToDOM"
```

Now with bindings out of the way, we can start writing some code.

```rust
pub fn main() {
    io.println("Hello from Gleam!")
    draw_to_dom(get_phone_model())
}
```

Now we can compile this by:
```bash
$> gleam build --target javascript
```

Now, we will bundle the final output and ship it to the `assets` folder and see it come to life.

```javascript
// <main.js>
import { main } from ".\build\dev\javascript\starlight\starlight.mjs"

main()
```

Now, we link it together.
```bash
$> deno bundle main.js output.js
```

Finally, we will ship the resulting JS to the `assets` folder and watch our app come to life!
