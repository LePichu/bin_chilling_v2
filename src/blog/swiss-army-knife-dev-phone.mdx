Over the past year, I have been primarily using my phone as a Development Environment, giving up not only using my Laptop for a long time, but also a ton of tools and resources that I'd be able to use otherwise, like Copilot, VSCode, IntelliJ, so many tools that I could no longer use, but I prevailed, I ended up figuring out how to program entirely on a phone like a fucking monk or pilgrim of sorts, this is my story, originally I was going to publish this post back in January, but I just decided to finally get around doing it because well, college started, and I need something to vent in, something to keep my sanity in check. So yeah, let's begin!

Through out this tutorial, we will install a shit ton of tools, the kinds of which are listed as follows:
- Terminal (Termux)
- Linux Distribution Environment (Fedora or Alpine)
- Code Editor (Helix or NeoVim)
- Runtimes, Compilers, and Tools
- VNC, and Wireless Keyboards (Optional)

> Before we begin, I am aware a lot of people reading this probably aren't aware of many things, like differences between a Shell and a Terminal. For those people, the simple explanation is that, the shell is the *interpreter* of the shell language specific to that shell, for example: **PowerShell** will execute `.ps1`, `.psm1` and other related files to it, but something like `sh` or `bash` will execute POSIX Shell scripts. The Terminal or Terminal Emulator however, will run these shells by providing a *Teletyper (TTY)* environment, and a GUI for the system it is running on.

# *\*Tips Fedora*\*
For this specific tutorial I'd like to use Fedora, a distribution made by the Fedora Team building on components funded, related, or made by Red Hat and IBM. I however, wrote this section in it's original glory back in January, and personally, I'd like to honour the *original* write-up in its full-fledged comedic and rage-induced glory. Without further adoâ€“ *transmission cuts in*

For this tutorial specifically, we will be building on top of a Fedora PRoot, there are obviously, other choices like Debian or Void, but over the years Fedora has become the one I most trust when it comes to stability and just working out of the box. First thing you wanna do is install `proot-distro`, and then log into it, do so by running the following commands:

```sh
$> pkg install proot-distro
...
$> proot-distro install fedora
...
$> proot-distro login fedora --termux-home
# The `--termux-home` flag mounts your $HOME into the PRoot btw
[root@localhost ]$
```

SHUT THE **FUCK** UP, I AM TIRED OF YOU *VOCAL MINORITIES*, GO BACK TO BEING A *FAT ASS BASEMENT DWELLER* IN ***YOUR MOM's*** BASEMENT WITH NO JOB INSTEAD OF *ANNOYING* ME. Are they gone yet? Yep, sorry for that outbreak, happens to the best of us ðŸ˜¿ . Oh wait you want Void or Alpine? We can also work with that, the process is pretty similar but unfortunately, you cannot run PowerShell on a Alpine PRoot even with `gcompat`, Best bet is to build it yourself manually for this case, anyways instead of `fedora` install `void` and then log into it, after that the process is practically the same if you're using the tarball version, which we will do here over distro-specific package managers.

```sh
$> wget https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.3.6/powershell-7.3.6-linux-arm64.tar.gz
...
$> mkdir pwsh
$> tar -xf ./powershell-7.3.6-linux-arm64.tar.gz -C pwsh
...
$> chmod +x ./pwsh/pwsh
$> ln -s /data/data/com.termux/files/home/pwsh/pwsh /usr/bin/pwsh
...
$> chmod +x /usr/bin/pwsh
```

With that being said, I might personally look into building PowerShell for ARM64 Alpine myself soon, so you can thank me later.  

When you boot up **PowerShell** for the first time, it can have a number of errors, well, primarily 2 of those that I know of, it either copes about having no `icu-libs` being present or CoreCLR cannot be created because your shitty ass phone, mine included, has only *4 fucking GB* of RAM or less, and that is a big no-no for CoreCLR. There is a simple fix for that, depending on your distro you just grab the right package, so that would be something like:

```sh
# Run xbps-install -u xbps if you haven't used the pkg manager before this command
# This is for void btw
xbps-install -S icu-libs
# This is for Fedora and RHEL-alike
dnf install libicu
```
