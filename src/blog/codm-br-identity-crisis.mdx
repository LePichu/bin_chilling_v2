Ever since Black Ops 4, Battle Royale has been a staple part of Call of Duty's culture. We have seen 4 interpretations of how Call of Duty's idea of a Battle Royale works, however, only one of them stands out as an odd ball. That odd ball being Call of Duty: Mobile. Ever since it's inception, the Battle Royale gamemode in CoDM has been plagued with various issues, weather it be being poorly designed, buggy, non-performant, or anything else.

# The Sandbox
Before we begin, I'd like to clarify something, I want you to think of Call of Duty as a framework of design, or a sandbox with certain implications out of the gate. Historically, Call of Duty has had an implied sandbox, a preconfigured environment with certain rules if you will. Every gamemode works in the said sandbox, and if it breaks said sandbox rules, however, there are cases where the sandbox is broken with results which are either desirable or not. The sandbox, if you think about it, primarily or mainly consists of the following:

- Weaponry in form of Guns and Melee Weapons
- Lethal and Tactical Tools or Weapons
- A Regenerative Health System
- Perks
- Round Based Matches or Respawns
- Operator Skills/Classes & Operator Weapons
- Vehicles
- The Undead 

Everything in Call of Duty builds around this framework, using some elements at a time, using them fine and it results in a good gamemode, and wrong, well, you know the deal. This also applies to Battle Royale, but how does it specifically apply to CoDM's BR? To understand that, we need to take a journey through time and see how we got here.
